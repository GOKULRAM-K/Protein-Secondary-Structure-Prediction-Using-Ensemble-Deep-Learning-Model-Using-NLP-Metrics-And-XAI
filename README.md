# Protein-Secondary-Structure-Prediction

### Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a research project focused on predicting protein secondary structure using ensemble deep learning techniques. The project leverages NLP metrics and explainable AI to improve model performance and interpretability.

These were coded using Google Colab Environment
## Data
The datasets used in this project are located in the datasets directory.

# Getting Started
## Set Up Environment:
<b> Google Colab:</b> <br>
Upload the .ipynb notebooks to a new Colab notebook. Upload the dataset files to the drive to connect them.

## NoteBooks:
<b>Sedondary_Structure_Prediction_using_3_Models.ipynb</b> <br> 
This holds:
1) Data Exploration
2) Model 1 - Sequence Processing Predictor
3) Model 2 - Enhanced Sequence-to-Sequence Predictor
4) Model 3 - Ensemble Model Harmonized Sequence Predictor
5) Comparing Models on datasets

Other Notebooks includes <br>

<b>  Model1_XAI_casp12.ipynb  </b> <br>
<b>  Model1_XAI_cb513.ipynb  </b> <br>
<b>  Model1_XAI_ts115.ipynb  </b> <br>
<b>  Model2_XAI_casp12.ipynb  </b> <br>
